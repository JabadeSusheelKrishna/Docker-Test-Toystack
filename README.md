# Hosting a Webiste in Toystack using Docker
- First be ready with your application code. here `app.py`
- Now create Docker file that is able to run your application.  here `Docker`
- Make sure that the docker file contains all the requirements.  here `requirements.txt`
- Now go to toystack and give authorization to your repo and deploy.
- After some time (if Docker file execution is successful) you will be able to see deployed link.

> # About Docker : 
Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It simplifies the development process by providing a consistent environment across different stages of development, testing, and production.

### Key Concepts and Components

1. **Containers**:
   - Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
   - They share the host system’s kernel but are isolated from each other and the host system.

2. **Images**:
   - Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. They are built from a set of instructions written in a Dockerfile.
   - An image can be based on another image, adding additional layers on top.

3. **Dockerfile**:
   - A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.
   - It specifies the base image, dependencies, configurations, and commands to run the application.

4. **Docker Engine**:
   - The Docker Engine is the underlying client-server technology that creates and runs containers.
   - It includes the Docker daemon (a background service running on the host) and a REST API for interacting with the daemon.

5. **Docker Hub**:
   - Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker users can create, test, store, and distribute container images.

### How Docker Works

1. **Building an Image**:
   - Create a Dockerfile with instructions on how to set up the environment and application.
   - Run the `docker build` command to create an image from the Dockerfile.
   - Example Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application:
     ```Dockerfile
     # Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
     FROM node:14

     # Set the working directory
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy package.json and install dependencies
     COPY package.json /app
     RUN npm install

     # Copy the rest of the application code
     COPY . /app

     # Expose the port the app runs on
     EXPOSE 3000

     # Run the application
     CMD ["node", "app.js"]
     ```

2. **Running a Container**:
   - Use the `docker run` command to create and start a container from an image.
   - Example command to run the Node.js application container:
     ```sh
     docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
     ```
   - This maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container.

3. **Managing Containers**:
   - Containers can be started, stopped, restarted, and removed using Docker commands.
   - Examples:
     ```sh
     docker start <container_id>
     docker stop <container_id>
     docker rm <container_id>
     ```

4. **Networking**:
   - Docker provides various networking options for containers to communicate with each other and with external networks.
   - By default, containers are isolated from each other, but they can be connected using Docker networks.

5. **Volumes**:
   - Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers. They allow data to be shared and reused among multiple containers.
   - Example command to create and use a volume:
     ```sh
     docker volume create my-volume
     docker run -v my-volume:/data my-node-app
     ```

### Benefits of Docker

- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that the application runs the same way regardless of the environment.
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any machine that has Docker installed, whether it’s a developer's laptop, a testing server, or a production environment.
- **Isolation**: Containers isolate applications from each other and the host system, reducing conflicts and improving security.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient in terms of resource usage compared to traditional virtual machines.

Docker has revolutionized the way applications are developed, shipped, and run, making the process more efficient and reliable.
